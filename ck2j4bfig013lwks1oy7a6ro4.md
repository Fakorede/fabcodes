## 10 Must Have VS Code Extensions for Developing with Laravel

As we all know, VS Code is one of the most popular code editors out there being used by developers if not the most popular.

Asides from its popularity and the fact that it is open source and cross platform, the reason I and of course most developers out there love VS code is the fact that it has lots of features which comes with it out of the box such as syntax highlighting, code completion, support for Git and GitHub and it also offers the capability of being fully customizable, allowing us as developers to be able to add extra functionality such as installing extensions or even changing preferences such as the default theme and keyboard shortcuts.

In this article, I will be discussing 10 extensions I believe are a must-have for improving your productivity and rapidly building your applications with the Laravel framework. 

Although there are many of these extensions available in the  [VS marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), here are a few i have tried and believe are worth sharing with other PHP/Laravel developers out there.
